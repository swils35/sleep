# Phase 2 - Tool Building

## Data Collection

**Technology:**
 1. Apple iWatch
 2. Autosleep App
 3. smartphone
 4. MapMyRun

**Technology Usage**
I am using my *iWatch* to monitor my exercise and sleeping. The Apple iWatch has an accelerometer, gyroscope, and heart rate monitor. 

When sleeping, these 3 tools are able to measure how still/ restless I am and my heart rate in beats per minute (BPM). The *Autosleep app* on my iWatch is synced with the same app on my *phone* which is my preferred interface for viewing and analyzing the data. 

When exercising, I use the iWatch's built in activity app which utilizes the same tools mentioned above to measure how my movement and my heart rate. For runs, I prefer to use the *MapMyRun* app on my phone as it is more accurate when measuring distance and speed due to a better GPS capabilities. However, the MapMyRun data does automatically sync up with my watch's activity app and the watch automatically measures my heart rate for the duration of the run. 

**Subjective Scoring**
I've created a subjective scoring system of each night's sleep. The *quality score* is a scale from 0 - 5 of how well rested I feel the day after. I make sure to record the quality score BEFORE looking at my data from the previous night's sleep to minimize possible bias.

0 = Give me coffee or face my wrath - lethargic, unable to concentrate
1 = Very low energy, difficult to concentrate
2 = A bit lethargic
3 = I could go for a nap - overall, I feel fully functional but could do with a 15 minute power nap
4 = I feel fairly well rested
5 = I've got energy to spare

**Excel Spreadsheet** 
I have created an excel spreadsheet(to be uploaded to Phase 3 branch) to record my data. The excel spreadsheet currently includes 4 tabs:
 1. data - This is the main data records. 
 2. quality_score_guide - The guide with the same listing as the above subjective scoring.
 3. data_types - A listing of the data type (integer/ text/ decimal, etc) for each column in the data tab.
 4. data_dictionary - More detailed information on the measurement collection and meaning of each column.
