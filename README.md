# Phase 1: Planning 

## Title: Exercise and Insomnia

Core Inquiry Question: What effect does regular exercise have on the sleep patterns of a person with anxiety-induced insomnia.

Rationale: My motivation for this project is motivation itself. I wish to quantify the effects of regular exercise on one of the most important aspects of a healthy lifestyle - sleep. 

Hypothesis: I believe that regular exercise will increase the hours of sleep I have and the amount of time it takes to fall asleep. I believe that this effect will be evident both the night after I've exercised and overall. I believe that this effect will occur because the exercise will make me physically tired. However, because my insomnia is due to anxiety, this may cause unexpected results. If I'm having a bad anxiety night, though I may be physically tired, it may not be enough to make me fall asleep or have a good night's sleep.
